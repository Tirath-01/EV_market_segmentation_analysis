# EV_market_segmentation_analysis
Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation analysis:-
The market segmentation approach aims at defining actionable, manageable, homogenous subgroups of individual customers to whom the marketers can target with a
similar set of marketing strategies. In practice, there are two ways of segmenting the market-a-priori and post-hoc. An a-priori approach utilizes predefined characteristics
such as age, gender, income, education, etc. to predefine the segments followed by profiling based on a host of measured variables (behavioral, psychographic or benefit). In
the post-hoc approach to segmentation on other hand, the segments are identified based on the relationship among the multiple measured variables. The commonality
between both approaches lies in the fact that the measured variables determine the ‘segmentation theme’. The present study utilizes an a-priori approach to segmentation
so as to divide the potential EV customers into sub-groups.It is argued that the blended approach of psychographic and socioeconomic attributes
for market segmentation enables the formulation of sub-market strategies which in turn satisfy the specific tastes and preferences of the consumer groups. Straughan and
Roberts presented a comparison between the usefulness of psychographic, demographic, and economic characteristics based on consumer evaluation for eco-friendly products.
They pinpointed the perceived superiority of the psychographic characteristics over the socio-demographic and economic ones in explaining the environmentally-conscious consumer behavior and thus, the study recommended the use of psychographic characteristics in profiling the consumer segments in the market for eco-friendly products. The
present study adds perceived-benefit characteristics guided by blended psychographic and socio-economic aspects for segmenting the consumer market.
